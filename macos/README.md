# MacOS

The only desktop OS worth using. macOS is [my favorite desktop operating system.](https://github.com/imabhaysutar/my-mac-os) I have always hated on windows and have tried using just Linux, liked it but it just lacks app support. Now it's all Mac land, I doubt I will ever be able to move to another operating system as I have too much invested in optimizing and using macOS. 

## Clean Install

You can clean install by going to Recovery mode \(restart with `cmd+r` pressed\). Then Disk Utility &gt; Select disk &gt; Erase \(Format it\) &gt; Close Disk Utility &gt; Select option Reinstall MacOS.

{% hint style="info" %}
Both MacOS and Windows too are at a point where clean installs are unnecessary. But personally i like to clean install yearly or if i have installed the beta version. There is something cathartic about a clean install.

## Setup

You can use a Time Machine backup, that's a better way to get things back on with ease. But for me I have made a [Setup script](https://github.com/imabhaysutar/MacOS-SetupScript) that installs all the apps and extensions that i use, plus it sets up some system preferences that i need.
