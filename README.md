# Introduction

### NOTE- Basics are work in progress.

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://imabhaysutar.gitbook.io/stuff-i-know/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/imabhaysutar/knowledge).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](./) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

### Using the wiki well

You can quickly search the contents of this wiki above or you can explore the tree view to the left.
